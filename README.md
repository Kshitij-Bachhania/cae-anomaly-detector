# CAE Anomaly Detector

This project detects anomalies in CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) simulation data using machine learning techniques.

## Overview

CAE simulations generate large amounts of data related to stress, deformation, and other physical parameters. This project applies anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual or unexpected patterns in the simulation results,
helping engineers quickly spot potential issues without manually reviewing all outputs.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning of CAE simulation output
- Implementation of anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest and DBSCAN
- Visualization of detected anomalies for easy interpretation
- Python-based pipeline with clear, documented code

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Prepare your CAE simulation data in CSV format.
2. Run the anomaly detection scripts.
3. Review the visualizations and anomaly reports to identify outliers.
